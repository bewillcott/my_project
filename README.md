# My Project

This project exists as a test bed for the [`FLogging Guide`][fg]'s example code.

You can also use it as a reference for your own customization of the `Flogging` crate.

### Note

The layout is _only_ a suggestion, and not a requirement. The custom files can be stored anywhere within your project.

## Multiple Branches

This project has been saved with multiple branches. This is to hopefully provide more than one example within the same project.

### [`master`]

The `master` branch just holds the common project related files.

### [`Usage_Macros`]

The `Usage_Macros` branch is an example using the macros in `flogging`.

#### [`Idea`]

The `Idea` branch is an example of using a global `DEBUG_LEVEL` setting, to control all, or most, mod/file level loggers.

### [`Usage_Methods`]

The `Usage_Methods` branch is an example using the methods in `flogging`.

### [`Usage_Hybrid`]

The `Usage_Hybrid` branch is an example of combining the benefits of both macros and
methods.

### [`Custom`]

The `Custom` branch is an example using both the macros and methods in `flogging`. In addition, it demonstrates the final code developed in the customization part of the `FLogging Guide`.
