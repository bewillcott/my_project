# My Project

This project exists as a test bed for the [`FLogging Guide`][fg]'s example code.

You can also use it as a reference for your own customization of the `Flogging` crate.

### Note

The layout is _only_ a suggestion, and not a requirement. The custom files can be stored anywhere within your project.
